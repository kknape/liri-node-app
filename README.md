# liri-node-app

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI will search
 - "Spotify" for songs
 - "Bands in Town" for concerts
 - "OMDB" for movies.

 We'll retrieve the data with Axios from the APIs for Spotify, Bands in Town and OMDB.
